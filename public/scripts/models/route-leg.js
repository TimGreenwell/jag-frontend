/*

Notes:
Patterns to consider:
Message - simple message exchange (might be converted into multiple messages)
Headers might include: expiration(ttl?), sequenceNumber, type(command/document)

Message Channel - message inserted into certain named channel
CompetingConsumers - several consumers compete for messages.
Content-Based Routing - something in message determines which client gets it (.choice.when(header("type").isEqualTo("ff"))
Selective Consumer - Consumer chooses which messages to take.
Event-Driven Consumer - (asynchronous receiver)
Polling Consumer - consumer will ask when its ready

Guaranteed Delivery -- can resend to that leg
Message Expiration -
